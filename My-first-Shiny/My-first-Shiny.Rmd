## Solar Still

Solar Still is an ancient desalination device. It absorbed the sunlight and turned the solar energy into heat, which heated the seawater to the steam. The steam was then condensed into water which was desalinated as drinking water. 

This is a picture of typical solar still.

## Solar Still Energy Efficiency

In solar still desalination process, solar energy was applied on water evaporation. Thus the effective energy could be calculated by the amount of drinking water we collected multiplied the water evaporation enthalpy. The total energy that solar still consumed was solar energy. So the formula is:

$$Efficiency = \frac{Water Production * \Delta H}{Solar Energy}$$
